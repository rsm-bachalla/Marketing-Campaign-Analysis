# Marketing Analysis and Campaign Optimization

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to enhance sales volume and customer satisfaction by integrating targeted promotional campaigns. This is achieved through a comprehensive marketing analysis of a grocery store dataset from Kaggle, coupled with data from three other tables from various sources.

## Data Preprocessing
- Removed duplicates and outliers.
- Eliminated redundant columns such as kids' home, teen home, and marital status.
- Performed median imputation on NULL values in the Income column.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The project involves analyzing around 12 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to gauge different parameters, including:
- Sales Channel vs. Recency
- Average Website Engagement by Sales Channel
- Average Customer Profitability Score
- Products frequently bought together
- Campaign Success Rate
- Store Purchase Ratio per Campaign
- Deal Seeking Behavior
- Average Spending on Non-Grocery Items
- Net Profit Per Campaign
- Average Spending by Education Level and No. of dependents
- Lifetime analysis based on customer joined date vs response rate, etc.

## Tableau Dashboard
A comprehensive Tableau dashboard was designed to provide users with targeted insights into campaign impact, sales metrics, and customer satisfaction. The dashboard includes visualizations for each KPI, allowing for easy interpretation and decision-making.

## Optimization Strategies
By incorporating Price, Promotion, and Product (PPP) data into the pricing strategies, the marketing campaigns were optimized, leading to a significant 15% cost reduction. The efficiency gains are clearly demonstrated by comparing the initial marketing campaign costs with the reduced expenses post-implementation of the analysis.

## Project Significance
- **Cost Reduction:** Achieved a 15% reduction in marketing campaign costs.
- **Targeted Insights:** Provided targeted insights into customer behavior, campaign success, and overall sales performance.
- **Enhanced Decision-Making:** Equipped users with valuable information for optimizing marketing strategies, resource allocation, and improving customer retention efforts.

## Future Enhancements
- Explore advanced machine learning models for predicting customer behavior.
- Continuously update the dashboard with real-time data for ongoing campaign optimization.
